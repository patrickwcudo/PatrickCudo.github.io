							<h1>Projects</h1>
							<h2>MLB Fantasy Points Per Game Predictor</h2>
							<p>This project was done for my Data Science Immersive Capstone. 
								The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict fantasy points per game for MLB players in the current 2021 season. 
								This model will be evaluated using RMSE and the model should improve upon the baseline by at least 25%. 
								The modelâ€™s predictions and coefficients will be used to create a lineup building application. 
								The application will provide a MLB daily fantasy lineup for a user. 
								This product is geared towards companies that provide services to fantasy players. 
								The product can be used in trial periods for potential users or as a product offered to existing users.</p>

							<h2>Evaluating Happiness in Children</h2>
							<p>The goal of this project was to evaluate the different factors that may put children at-risk for developing poor mental health. We examined 
								the effect of factors such as special healthcare needs, behavior, healthcare access, and physical health check-ups. Within our dataset, 
								our target variable was UNHAP42. This variable was gathered from a survey that asks children whether or not they feel unhappy or sad.</p>

							<h2>NLP - Subreddit Comment Project</h2>
							<p>Scraped thousands of comments from two subreddits, r/DFSports and r/sportsbook, using the Pushshift reddit API.  
								After the process of cleaning, lemmatizationing, and creating custom stop words the comments were
								analyzed as tokens through count vectorization.  The final logistic regression model provided an accuracy score of 83% on unseen comments.</p>
